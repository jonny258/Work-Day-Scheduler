## 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
# Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The application features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and uses the Day.js library to work with date and time.

When the application is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. Scrolling down reveals time blocks for standard business hours, with each time block color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Users can click into a time block and enter an event. Clicking the save button for that time block saves the text for that event in local storage.

Even after refreshing the page, the saved events persist thanks to local storage. With this application, busy employees can easily manage their time effectively by adding important events to a daily planner.
